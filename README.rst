  <b><i>A quick and nifty tool for genotyping and phasing popular pharmacogenes.</i></b>
  </p>


Aldy calls genotypes of many highly polymorphic pharmacogenes and reports them in a phased star-allele nomenclature.
It can¬†also call copy number of a given pharmacogene, and genotype each copy present in the sample‚Äîsomething that standard genotype callers like GATK cannot do.

Algorithm details
=================

TL;DR: Aldy uses star-allele databases to guide the process of detecting the most likely genotype.
The optimization is done in three stages via integer linear programming.

Aldy has been published in `Nature Communications <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03273-1>`_
(`doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03273-1 <http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03273-1>`_).

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
==========

If you are using Aldy in a clinical or commercial environment, **please read this carefully**.

Aldy is a computational tool whose purpose is to *aid the genotype detection process*. It can be of tremendous help in that process, however it is not perfect, and it can easily make a wrong call if the data is noisy, ambigious or if the target sample contains a previously unknown allele.

‚ò£Ô∏èüö® **Do not use the raw output of Aldy (or any other computational tool for that matter) to diagnose a disease or prescribe a drug!**
**It is your responsibility to validate every result manually or (ideally) in a wetlab before doing something that can have major consequences.** üö®‚ò£Ô∏è

We really mean it.

Finally, note that the allele databases are still work in progress, and that we still do not know the downstream impact of vast majority of genotypes.

Installation
============

Aldy is written in Python, and requires Python 3.7+.
It is intended to be run on POSIX-based systems
(so far, only Linux and macOS have been tested).

The easiest way to install Aldy is to use `pip`::

    pip install aldy

Append ``--user`` to the previous command to install Aldy locally
if you cannot write to the system-wide Python directory.


Prerequisite: ILP solver
------------------------

Aldy requires a mixed integer solver to run.

The following solvers are currently supported:

* `CBC / Google OR-Tools <https://developers.google.com/optimization/>`_:
  a free, open-source MIP solver that is shipped by default with Google's OR-Tools.
  `pip` installs it by default when installing Aldy.

       If you have trouble installing `ortools` on a Nix-based Linux distro, try this::

           pip install --platform=manylinux1_x86_64 --only-binary=:all: --target ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages ortools

* `Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com>`_:
  a commercial solver which is free for academic purposes.
  Most thoroughly tested solver: if you encounter any issues with CBC, try Gurobi.
  After installing it, don't forget to install ``gurobipy`` package by going to
  Gurobi's installation directory
  (e.g. ``/opt/gurobi/linux64`` on Linux or ``/Library/gurobi751/mac64/`` on macOS)
  and typing::

      python3 setup.py install

* `SCIP <http://scip.zib.de>`_: another solver which is also free for academic purposes.
  SCIP is easier to install than Gurobi (no registration or activation required).
  However, it might be slower than Gurobi.
  Once you you install SCIP, please install
  `PySCIPPpt <https://github.com/SCIP-Interfaces/PySCIPOpt>`_ module for the Python
  SCIP bindings via `pip`: ``pip install pyscipopt``. If it fails, make sure to set
  `SCIPOPTDIR` environmental variable to point to SCIP's install directory.



Sanity check
============

After installing Aldy and a compatible ILP solver, please make sure to test
the installation by issuing the following command (this should take a few minutes)::

    aldy test

In case everything is set up properly, you should see something like this::

Running
=======

Aldy needs a SAM, BAM, or a CRAM file for genotyping.
We will be using BAM as an example.

.. attention::
  It is assumed that reads are mapped to hg19 (GRCh37) or hg38 (GRCh38). Other reference genomes are not yet supported.

An index is needed for BAM files. Get one by running::

    samtools index file.bam

Aldy is invoked as::

    aldy genotype -p [profile] -g [gene] file.bam

Sequencing profile selection
----------------------------

The ``[profile]`` argument refers to the sequencing profile.
The following profiles are available:

- ``illumina`` for Illumina WGS or exome (WXS) data (or any uniform-coverage technology).

.. attention::
  It is highly recommended to use samples with at least 40x coverage.
  Anything lower than 20x will result in tears and agony.

- ``pgx1`` for PGRNseq v.1 capture protocol data
- ``pgx2`` for PGRNseq v.2 capture protocol data
- ``pgx3`` for PGRNseq v.3 capture protocol data

- ``wxs`` for whole-exome sequencing data

   .. attention::
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Be warned!:** whole-exome data is incomplete *by definition*, and Aldy will not be able to call majoe star-alleles that are
   defined by their intronic or upstream variants.
   Aldy also assumes that there are only two (2) gene copies if `wxs` profile is used, as it cannot call copy number changes nor fusions from exome data.

If you are using different technology (e.g. some home-brewed capture kit),
you can proceed provided that the following requirements are met:

- all samples have the similar coverage distribution
  (i.e. two sequenced samples with the same copy number configuration
  MUST have similar coverage profiles; please consult us if you are not sure about this)
- your panel includes a copy-number neutral region
  (currently, Aldy uses *CYP2D8* as a copy-number neutral region,
  but it can be overridden).

Having said that, you can use a sample BAM that is known to have two copies
of the genes you wish to genotype (without any fusions or copy number alterations)
as a profile as follows::

    aldy genotype -p profile-sample.bam -g [gene] file.bam

Alternatively, you can generate a profile for your panel/technology by running::

    # Get the profile
    aldy profile profile-sample.bam > my-cool-tech.profile
    # Run Aldy
    aldy genotype -p my-cool-tech.profile -g [gene] file.bam


Output
======

Aldy will by default generate the following file: ``file-[gene].aldy``
(default location can be changed via ``-o`` parameter).
Aldy also supports VCF file output: just append `.vcf` to the output file name.
The summary of results are shown at the end of the output::

    $ aldy -p pgrnseq-v2 -g cyp2d6 NA19788.bam

    Potential CYP2D6 copy number configurations for NA07048:

          Confidence: 1.00 (score = 25.73)
      2: *1/*4-like
          Minor: *1, *4EW +42525810:SNP.TC*
          Confidence: 1.00 (score = 25.73)
    CYP2D6 results:
      *1-like/*4                     (*1 +42525810:SNP.TC*, *4.b)
      *1/*4-like                     (*1, *4.b +42525810:SNP.TC*)

In this example, *CYP2D6* genotype is \*1/\*4 as expressed in terms of
major star-alleles.
Minor star-alleles are given after each "best" star-allele (here, \*1 and \*4EW).
Note that there is a novel SNP here (42525810:SNP.TC) that Aldy assigned to \*1
(and \*4 in the second solution). The presence of a novel functional SNP causes Aldy to
report modified allele with the suffix `-like` (e.g. `*1-like`).
Minor alleles might have additional mutations, or might lose some default mutations.
Additions are marked with `+` in front (e.g. `*1 +42525810:SNP.TC*`).
Losses carry `-` in front.

Confidence scores express Aldy's confidence in a solution.
Maximum score is 1.0. By default, Aldy only reports solutions that have the
confidence score of 1.0. Use `--gap` to report more solutions.

Explicit decomposition is given in the ``file-[gene].aldy``
(in the example above, it is ``NA19788_x.CYP2D6.aldy``).
An example of such file is::

    #Sample	Gene	SolutionID	Major	Minor	Copy	Allele	Location	Type	Coverage	Effect	dbSNP	Code	Status

The columns stand for:
- sample name,
- gene name,
- solution count (different solutions have different counts),
- major star-allele call,
- minor star-allele call,
- allele copy identifier (0 for the first allele in the minor column, 1 for the second and so on)
- mutation locus,
- mutation type (SNP or indel),
- mutation coverage,
- mutation functionality:
  - ``DISRUPTING`` for gene-disrupting
  - ``NEUTRAL`` for neutral mutation,
- dbSNP ID (if available),
- traditional Karolinska-style mutation code from CYP allele database, and
- mutation status, which indicates the status of the mutation in the decomposition:

    + ``NORMAL``: mutation is associated with the star-allele in the database, and is found in the sample
    + ``NOVEL``: gene-disrupting mutation is **NOT** associated with the star-allele in the database,
      but is found in the sample (this indicates that Aldy found a novel major star-allele)
    + ``EXTRA``: neutral mutation is **NOT** associated with the star-allele in the database,
      but is found in the sample (this indicates that Aldy found a novel minor star-allele)
    + ``MISSING``: neutral mutation is associated with the star-allele in the database,
      but is **NOT** found in the sample (this also indicates that Aldy found a novel minor star-allele)

VCF support
-----------

The output will be a VCF file if the output file extension is `.vcf`.
Aldy will report a VCF sample for each potential solution, and the appropriate genotypes.
Aldy will also output tags `MA` and `MI` for major and minor solutions.

  **Note:** VCF is not optimal format for star-allele reporting. Unless you really need it,
  we recommend using Aldy's default format.


Problems & Debugging
--------------------

If you encounter any issues with Aldy, please run Aldy with debug parameter:

   aldy genotype ... --debug debuginfo

This will produce `debuginfo.tar.gz` file that contains sample and LP model dumps.
Please send us this file and we will try to resolve the issue.

This file contains no private information of any kind except for the mutation counts
at the target gene locus and the file name.

**OPTIONS**:
------------

Global arguments:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``-h, --help``

  Show the help message and exit.

* ``-v, --verbosity VERBOSITY``

  Logging verbosity. Acceptable values:

  - ``T`` (trace)
  - ``D`` (debug),
  - ``I`` (info), and
  - ``W`` (warn)

  *Default:* ``I``

* ``-l, --log LOG``

  Location of the output log file.

  *Default:* no log file


Commands:
^^^^^^^^^

* ``help``

  Show the help message and exit.

* ``license``

  Print Aldy license.

* ``test``

  Run Aldy test suite.

* ``query``, ``q``

  Query a gene or an allele.

  You can specify a gene name (e.g. ``aldy query CYP2D6``) or an allele (e.g. ``aldy query 'CYP2D6*121'`` or ``aldy q 'CYP2D6*4C'``).

* ``profile [FILE]``

  Generate a copy-number profile for a custom sequencing panel and
  print it on the standard output.
  ``FILE`` is a SAM/BAM sample that is known to have two copies of the gene of interest
  (without any fusions or copy number alterations).

* ``genotype``

  Genotype a SAM/BAM sample. Arguments:

  - ``FILE``

    SAM, BAM, or CRAM file. CRAM requires ``--reference`` as well.

  - ``-T, --threshold THRESHOLD``

    Cut-off rate for variations (percent per copy).
    Any variation with normalized coverage less than the threshold will be ignored.

    *Default:* `50`

  - ``-p, --profile PROFILE``

    Sequencing profile. Supported values are:

    + ``illumina``
    + ``wxs``
    + ``pgx1``
    + ``pgx2``
    + ``pgx3``.

    You can also pass a SAM/BAM file
    (please check the documentation quick-start for more details).
    Also consult ``profile`` command.

  - ``-g, --gene GENE``

    Gene profile.

    *Default:* ``CYP2D6``

  - ``-o, --output OUTPUT``

    Location of the output file.

    *Default:* ``[input].[gene].aldy``

  - ``-s, --solver SOLVER``

    ILP Solver. Currently supported solvers are Gurobi, SCIP and CBC.
    You can also pass ``any`` to let Aldy choose the best (available) solver.

    *Default:* ``any`` (uses CBC if available, then Gurobi, then SCIP).

  - ``-c, --cn CN``

    Manually specify a copy number configuration.
    Input: a comma-separated list of configurations ``CN1,CN2,...``.
    For a list of supported configurations, please run::

        aldy query [GENE]

  - ``-r, --reference REF``

    FASTA reference for reference-encoded CRAM files.

  - ``-n, --cn-neutral-region CN_NEUTRAL``

    Provide a custom copy-number neutral region.
    Format is ``chr:start-end``.

    *Default:* *CYP2D8* (22:42547463-42548249 for hg19)

  - ``-G, --gap GAP``

    Solution gap.
    By setting this to any positive value, Aldy will also report solutions whose score
    is less than (1+GAP) times the optimal solution score.
    Useful for exploring the solution space.

    *Default:* 0 (only optimal solutions allowed)

  - ``-d, --debug DEBUG``

    Create a DEBUG.tar.gz file that can be shared with the authors for easier debugging.
    Contains no private information except the file name and sample mutation counts in
    the gene of interest.

  - ``-f, --fusion-penalty FUSION_PENALTY``

    Penalize each fusion additional FUSION_PENALTY times.
    Larger values mean lower likelihood of seeing fusions.

    *Default:* 0.1

  - ``--max-minor-solutions MAX_MINOR_SOLUTIONS``

    Maximum number of minor solutions to report.
    Default setting is to output only one even if there are multiple minor (non-functional) phases.

    *Default:* 1

  - ``--multiple-warn-level MULTIPLE_WARN_LEVEL``

    Warning level when multiple optimal solutions are found.

    If set to 1, Aldy will warn if multiple final optimal solutions are found.
    If set to 2, Aldy will also warn if multiple optimal major star-allele solutions are found.
    If set to 3, Aldy will even warn if multiple copy-number configurations are found.

    *Default:* 1

  - ``--phase PHASE``

    Path to `HapTree-X_<https://github.com/0xTCG/haptreex>` or `HapCUT2_<https://github.com/vibansal/HapCUT2>` phase file
    that can be used to properly resolve multiple optimal solutions and generate more accurate phasing.
